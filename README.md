# time-resolved-odmr
Measurement code for controlling a time resolved optically detected magnetic resonance setup. Developed for the "Nanotechnology and Quantum Applications Specialization Laboratory 2" course at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

Device drivers are provided for every device used in the lab exercise (SRS SR830M, Kuhne MKU LO 8-13 PLL and [pico-pulse](https://github.com/bgoblyos/pico-pulse)). Fully scripted experiments are also included for reference.
